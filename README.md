## Neighbourhood Map project

A one page application which contains a map of your favorite area showing markers of some great places of that area. I have created a map for Hyderabad and places to visit there.

### Getting started

Instructions to run site:

1. Fork & Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` file.
3. A list of locations is there. Click on a location to get info about the location in an infowindow.
4. Used FourSquare API to get location based details.

### Customize it according to your favorite Area

1. Open `main.js` in `js` directory.
2. Replace the `titles` and `latLng` positions accordingly.
